In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to do necessary actions.

	If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page.
	Access to system resources of the application
	Our apps sometimes require Internet access to enhance the app experience, and to show ads when using apps, it's the only source of funding that helps us keep up and running. Develop applications, hope you do not feel uncomfortable because of that
